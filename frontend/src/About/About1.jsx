                  After tireless efforts by Bishnu P. Bhushal (Chief District Officer, Nepal Government) and our Organization President, Ram Julum Yadav, we finally got registration in 2024 with a mission to combat child exploitation, particularly
                  child marriage and child labor, in Nepalâ€™s remote areas. We are committed to empowering children through education, mentorship, and awareness programs, ensuring they have the knowledge and resources to break free from societal
                  limitations and pursue brighter futures.
